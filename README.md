This is an interpreter for the Esoteric Programming Language Trampolines (https://esolangs.org/wiki/Trampolines). This is the most recent version.

TrampolinesInterpreter.lua does not take any arguments.
It'll ask you for a file when it runs, and then runs after that.
It contains a debugger with a visualization of the marble and the stacks.
This file is meant more for directly running within the console.

TrampolinesInterpreterNOINITIALSTDIO.lua takes six arguments, listed within the file itself.
This file is meant more for embedding into other things, so it doesn't have a debugger.

oh lua my beloved
